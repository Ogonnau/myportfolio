								<center><p><strong>1853 Stockholm Cholera Outbreak: Death Analysis</strong></p></center>
								<p>The 1853 Stockholm cholera outbreak was a severe occurrence of cholera in Stockholm, Sweden, during the third cholera pandemic. 
									The dataset for this analysis, provided by Quantum Analytics NG, was sourced from handwritten church records, as the church managed all population registration until around 1870. </p> 
									Originally in Swedish, the dataset was translated to English for clarity using Google Translate.
								<p>This analysis aims to understand the spread and impact of the outbreak and identify vulnerable demographic groups.
								</p>
								<p>Key observations from the analysis include: <br>

									- A total of 248 deaths were recorded, with 52% female and 48% male. The average age of the deceased was 34 years. <br>
									- September had the highest mortality rate, while December had the fewest deaths. <br>
									- Most deaths occured among the adult age group.</p>
								<p>Recommendation <br>
									To improve cholera prevention and response, it is essential to strengthen early detection systems, enhance public health education and invest in better sanitation and water quality.</p>

								<center><p><strong>NCDC COVID-19 Report</strong></p></center>
								<p>Using data from the NCDC website, this analysis aims to examine the trend in confirmed Covid-19 cases in Nigeria over recent years.</p>
								<p>Key Insights: <br>
								- The Federal Capital Territory and Lagos have the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths. This is understandable as these are urban areas with significant business activity. <br>
								- January and December had the highest number of confirmed cases, which is likely due to increased gatherings during these months. <br>
								- Protocols such as wearing masks and avoiding large crowds were implemented to curb the pandemic.  2021 to 2022 shows a significant decline in confirmed cases, suggesting the effectiveness of these measures. </p>
								<p>Recommendation <br>
								The government should continue to encourage proper hygiene practices, such as handwashing, wearing masks and maintaining social distance in gatherings.</p>

								<center><p><strong>Global Shark Attack Analysis</strong></p></center>
								<p>This dataset documents reported shark attacks spanning the last century (1900-2017), detailing information such as location, activity, victim demographics (name, gender, age), shark species involved, and more. 
									The primary aim of this analysis is to uncover insights into the prevalence of shark attacks across different countries, identify peak seasons, analyse the most common times of day for attacks, and determine which country had the highest incidence of shark attacks. </p>
								<p>Key Insights: <br>
									- Among the 1259 countries analysed, the United States reported the highest number of shark attacks, with Smyrna Beach, the world's most renowned beach, ranking highest in terms of attack occurrences by location. <br>
									- The summertime and afternoons were found to have the highest incidence of shark attacks, likely due to increased beach visitation during hot weather when people are more inclined to spend time outdoors.
								</p>
								<p>Recommendation <br>
								Awareness should be raised particularly among tourists, to minimize the risk of shark encounters and implementing educational programs at beaches to inform visitors about the risks and benefits of swimming in the ocean before entering the water.</p>

								<center><p><strong>New York Taxi Trips Analysis</strong></p></center>
								<p>This analysis focuses on New York City taxi trips from 2017 to 2020, with the dataset cleaned and visualized using PowerBI. Several modifications were applied to the raw data, including filtering out trips sent via "store and forward," 
								considering only street-hailed trips paid by card or cash at a standard rate, removing trips outside the 2017-2020 timeframe or with unknown pickup/drop-off zones, and adjusting records with missing passenger counts or erroneous date/times. <br>
								The objective of this analysis is to provide insights into New York's taxi system for stakeholders and passengers.</p>
								<p>Key Insights: <br>
								- Trips peaked in 2017 but declined gradually, with a significant drop in 2020 attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent business closures and remote work arrangements. <br>
								- The average trip fare of $14 may be influenced by New York's busy traffic and urban environment, contributing to higher fares. <br>
								- Most trips occurred during morning and evening rush hours, coinciding with commuter travel patterns. <br>
								</p>
								<p>Recommendation <br>
								To reduce fares, taxis could be optimized to accommodate more than one passenger traveling along the same route or business axis. 
								This shared taxi model could help mitigate fare increases associated with longer travel times and contribute to operational cost efficiencies.</p>
